## 🤖 How This Was Built — Using GitHub Copilot CLI

All analysis in this repo was generated by simply **asking GitHub Copilot CLI questions in plain English** — no code was written manually.

### Example prompts used:

**1. Read and review the file**
```
> there is a spss file, can you read and review it?
```

**2. Generate a cross-tabulation table**
```
> can you generate table: Beginning Salary by gender and education
```

**3. Publish to GitHub**
```
> let's share sav, py and md in my github
```

Copilot CLI handled everything: reading the `.sav` file, installing missing packages, writing Python scripts, and pushing to GitHub.
